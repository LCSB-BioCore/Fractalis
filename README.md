### About
This is the back-end component of the Fractalis project. It is a computational node that is responsible for the MicroETL process and the execution of analytical tasks.

### Demo
Please have a look at this playlist to see a demo of the visual aspects of Fractalis: [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNvp9GB9uBmH1NNAf-qTyj_jN2aCPISFU).

### Installation (Docker)
The easiest and most convenient way to deploy Fractalis is using Docker.
All necessary information can be found in the docker folder.

### Installation (Manual)
If you do not want to use docker or want a higher level of control of the several components, that's fine. In fact it isn't difficult to setup Fractalis manually:

- Install and run [Redis](https://redis.io/), which is available on most Linux distributions. This instance must be accessible by the web service and the workers.
- Install and run [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/), which is available on most Linux distributions. This instance must be accessible by the web service and the workers.
- Install Fractalis via `pip3 install fractalis`. Please note that Fractalis requires Python3.4 or higher. This must be installed on all machines that will run the web service or the workers.
- Install required all required R packages. We won't list these packages excplicitely, as they can change frequently. Please refer instead to the [Dockerfile](https://git-r3lab.uni.lu/Fractalis/fractalis/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile), which is *always* up-to-date, as a new version of Fractalis is only released when the Docker image passes all tests. This must be installed on all machines that will run the web service or the workers.
- Run and expose the Fractalis web service with whatever tools you want. We recommend **gunicorn** and **nginx**, but others should work, too.
- Run the celery workers on any machine that you want within the same network. (For a simple setup this can be the very same machine that the web service runs on).

Note: The [docker-compose.yml](https://git-r3lab.uni.lu/Fractalis/fractalis/blob/master/docker/docker-compose.yml) describes how the different services are started and how they connect with each other.

### Configuration (Docker)
1. Modify [docker/fractalis/config.py](https://git-r3lab.uni.lu/Fractalis/fractalis/blob/master/docker/config/fractalis/config.py) before `running docker-compose up`.

2. Replace the [dummy certificates](https://git-r3lab.uni.lu/Fractalis/fractalis/tree/master/docker/config/nginx/certs) with your own. The included one are only for development purposes.

Tip: Use the [default settings](https://git-r3lab.uni.lu/Fractalis/fractalis/blob/master/fractalis/config.py) as an example for your own configuration file.
Please note, that all this files combines [Flask settings](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/config/), [Celery settings](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html), and Fractalis settings, which are all listed and documented within this file. 
Please don't overwrite default settings if you don't know what you are doing. This might have severe implications for security or might cause Fractalis to not work correctly.

### Configuration (Manual)
Use the environment variable `FRACTALIS_CONFIG` to define the configuration file path.
This variable must be a) a valid python file (.py) and b) be available on all instances that host a Fractalis web service or a Fractalis worker.

### Add support for new services
Support for other services is exclusively implemented within [this folder](https://git-r3lab.uni.lu/Fractalis/fractalis/tree/master/fractalis/data/etls). We recommend looking at the *ada* example implementation. Just make sure you use the class inheritance (ETL, ETLHandler) correctly, and you will get readable error messages if something goes wrong.
